RELEASENOTES MARLIN VERSION 8.x
===============================

For releasenotes of the previous main version (7.x), see the separate file "Releasenotes_v7.txt".
This document contains all release notes and remarks beginning with version 8.0. The document
would otherwise grow to large and complex.

Version 8.x contains the new BaseLibrary where all general classes are moved into a library
that can be shared with other library modules like SQLComponents and CXHibernate
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Added named SSE Events in the ServerEventChannels. So that you can sent other 'normal'
    messages, not named 'message' through an SSE channel.
2)  Extra checks on the initial handling of an incoming SSE event channel. If the channel cannnot
    be authenticated, the server must bail-out correctly and destroy the new stream.
3)  Authentication challenges can be ignored in case of an Ajax XHTTPRequest in the server
    by setting the "SetXHTTPRequest" member with the boolean parameter to 'true'.
4)  Removed the checking of the 'last-error-status' when registering a site.
    Despite the fact that this was done in a thread-local-storage variable, this could go wrong
    in real life production scenario's. The 'tls_lastErrror' variable has been removed from the 
    HTTPServer altogether. The creation of new sites can no longer be stopped by this situation.


CHANGES IN VERSION 8.3.3 of 28-07-2024
--------------------------------------
1)  Update to the latest version of the BaseLibrary
2)  Fix for the return HTTP status of a JSON message
3)  Small Unicode fixes
4)  Retry of the reading of the IIS "ApplicationHost.config" file, in order to defeat the IIS 
    WAS service from blocking us to read the config file.
5)  Character encoding 'endlosung'. SendUnicode status now completely replaced by 'Encoding'
    of the charset.

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.3.2 of 08-07-2024
--------------------------------------
1)  Added checks that the "C:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config" file can
    be read. This file is used to register the sites in IIS.
    Checks are made in the following order:
    o   The file exists and can be read in MarlinModule
    o   The logfile base path is not empty in ServerApp
    o   The escape to the %TMP% directory did work correctly
2)  A new installer for MarlinModule has been released.

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.3.2 of 05-06-2024
--------------------------------------
1)  HTTPClient now has a new method "SetResolveChunked(bool)" for removing the response header
    'Transfer-encoding: chunked' on incoming received messages. So any framework can pass on the
    received header as a normal message with a content length.
    Use this method before sending a HTTP/SOAP/JSON Message
2)  Upon conversion of a SOAP/JSON message back to a HTTPMessage, the content length will be 
    restored to the now changed content.
3)  Marlin project is synched with the last version of the BaseLibrary
4)  The ServerEventDriver has been rewritten as to lower the lock-level of outgoing events.
    Alsoo the number of channels is reduced by only trying the channels with outgoing events.
    Long-Polling events are copied to their own queue, where one (1) client can retrieve them.

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.3.0 of 03-11-2023
--------------------------------------
1)  Fully Unicode Aware. Can build in ANSI/MBCS mode or in Unicode UTF-16 mode
2)  Fully tested in IIS for Unicode

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.2.0 of 23-07-2032
--------------------------------------
1)  Fully checked with CPPCheck 2.11
    As much as possible of all category "errors", "warnings", "style" and "performance"
    removed from the source code. A 'BaseLibrary.cppcheck' project file is checked in
2)  As a result of the CCPCheck, many declarations are now 'const reference'
    Beware as you take this version into production on another project

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.1.3 of 31-10-2022
--------------------------------------
1)  Updated to BaseLibrary 1.0.8. With JSONPath filters.
2)  Simpler and reliable fixes for the EventLogRegistration.
3)  Added websocket test HTML and minimal script example.

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.1.2 of 29-09-2022
--------------------------------------
1)  Updated the BaseLibrary for the Code Analysis corrections
2)  Ran "Code Analysis" with the standard "Microsoft Native ruleset" and corrected many little
    bugs and quirks.

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.1.1 of 24-07-2022
--------------------------------------
1)  Updated the BaseLibrary to version 1.0.4
    XMLMessage parsing + MultipartBuffer headers support
    Fixing the linker errors and references to the *.pdb

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.1.0 of 09-06-2022
--------------------------------------
1)  Removed the ZIP and ZLib directories from Marlin, as these methods are now supported by
    the new BaseLibrary
2)  BaseLibrary upgraded to version 1.0.2
3)  OAuth2Cache fixes for multithreaded environments
4)  Cookie attributes 'path', 'domain', Max-Age and 'expires' are now configurable in the Marlin.Config
    There is an extra dialog in the HTTPManager to set the values for these attributes.
    The server will honor these attributes when adding the Set-Cookie header to an HTTP answer.

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.0.0 of 21-03-2022
--------------------------------------
1)  Moved all general classes and functions to the "BaseLibrary"
2)  To compile your programs with this version of Marlin, do the following
    o   Replace #include "Analysis.h" for #include "LogAnalysis.h"
    o   Replace all occurences of "JsonEncoding" with "StringEncoding"
    o   Replace all occurences of "XmlEncoding"  with "StringEncoding"
    o   Replace all occurences of "CString" with "XString"
3)  Rewrite your 'stdafx.h' or 'pch.h' files to include the 'BaseLibrary.h'
    See the 'readme.md' of https://github.com/edwig/BaseLibrary/readme.md
4)  Add the path to '$(SolutionDir)BaseLibrary\' in your compiler settings
    under 'Project properties/C++/General/Additional Include Directories'
5)  Added method XMLMessage::CleanUpElement and SOAPMessage::CleanUp
    These can (recursively) clean out empty XMLElements that are no longer deemed relevant
    for the functioning of the message.
6)  In case of a SOAPMessage with an invalid 'SoapAction' name by XML rules, the SOAP 
    message object and the parameter object (first node within the body) will temporarily
    be generated as 'SoapAction'.

1)  Authentication challenges can be ignored in case of an Ajax XHTTPRequest in the server
    by setting the "SetXHTTPRequest" member with the boolean parameter to 'true'.
