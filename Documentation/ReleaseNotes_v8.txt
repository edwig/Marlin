RELEASENOTES MARLIN VERSION 8.x
===============================

For releasenotes of the previous main version (7.x), see the separate file "Releasenotes_v7.txt".
This document contains all release notes and remarks beginning with version 8.0. The document
would otherwise grow to large and complex.

Version 8.x contains the new BaseLibrary where all general classes are moved into a library
that can be shared with other library modules like SQLComponents and CXHibernate
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.0.1 of 27-04-2022
--------------------------------------
1)  Removed the ZIP and ZLib directories from Marlin, as these methods are now supported by
    the new BaseLibrary
2)  BaseLibrary upgraded to version 1.0.2
3)  OAuth2Cache fixes for multithreaded environments

CHANGES IN VERSION 8.0.0 of 21-03-2022
--------------------------------------
1)  Moved all general classes and functions to the "BaseLibrary"
2)  To compile your programs with this version of Marlin, do the following
    o   Replace #include "Analysis.h" for #include "LogAnalysis.h"
    o   Replace all occurences of "JsonEncoding" with "StringEncoding"
    o   Replace all occurences of "XmlEncoding"  with "StringEncoding"
    o   Replace all occurences of "CString" with "XString"
3)  Rewrite your 'stdafx.h' or 'pch.h' files to include the 'BaseLibrary.h'
    See the 'readme.md' of https://github.com/edwig/BaseLibrary/readme.md
4)  Add the path to '$(SolutionDir)BaseLibrary\' in your compiler settings
    under 'Project properties/C++/General/Additional Include Directories'
5)  Added method XMLMessage::CleanUpElement and SOAPMessage::CleanUp
    These can (recursively) clean out empty XMLElements that are no longer deemed relevant
    for the functioning of the message.
6)  In case of a SOAPMessage with an invalid 'SoapAction' name by XML rules, the SOAP 
    message object and the parameter object (first node within the body) will temporarily
    be generated as 'SoapAction'.
