For releasenotes of the previous main version (7.x), see the separate file "Releasenotes_v7.txt".
This document contains all release notes and remarks beginning with version 8.0. The document

Version 8.x contains the new BaseLibrary where all general classes are moved into a library
that can be shared with other library modules like SQLComponents and CXHibernate

2)  To compile your programs with this version of Marlin, do the following
    o   Replace #include "Analysis.h" for #include "LogAnalysis.h"
    o   Replace all occurences of "JsonEncoding" with "StringEncoding"
    o   Replace all occurences of "XmlEncoding"  with "StringEncoding"
    o   Replace all occurences of "CString" with "XString"
3)  Rewrite your 'stdafx.h' or 'pch.h' files to include the 'BaseLibrary.h'
    See the 'readme.md' of https://github.com/edwig/BaseLibrary/readme.md
4)  Add the path to '$(SolutionDir)BaseLibrary\' in your compiler settings
    under 'Project properties/C++/General/Additional Include Directories'
