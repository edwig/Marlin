RELEASENOTES MARLIN VERSION 6.x
===============================

For releasenotes of the previous main version (5.x), see the separate file "Releasenotes_v5.txt".
This document contains all release notes and remarks beginning with version 6.0. The document
would otherwise grow to large and complex.

Version 6.x contains the new HTTPSYS user mode driver as a HTTPServerAPI replacement
It is tested through the "MarlinServerSync" test program only
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.0.0 Beta 1
-------------------------------
1) NTLM/Digest/Kerberos authtentication working through standard SSPI interfaces
2) Rudementary implementation of keep-alive connections
3) HTTPServer now does send "Date" response header for authentication purposes

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.0.0 Pre-Alpha
----------------------------------
1) The HTTPSYS driver has been added to the project. It is a user mode implementation of the
   standard MS-Windows HTTP-Server-API as serviced by the "HTTP.SYS" kernel mode driver.
   It supports version 2.0 of the HTTPServer-API only.
   The driver was created for various reasons:
   - Educational purposes
   - Non-disclosed functions (websockets)
   - Because it can be done :-)
   Not implemented features of HTTP.SYS are:
   - Asynchronous I/O
   - HTTP 2.0 Server push
   - HTTP-Server-API release 1.0 functions.

   Applications can use the HTTPSYS driver just by altering the LINK input from "httpapi.lib" to "httpsys.lib"
   Nothing else is required to use the driver!

2) Yet to be implemented before we reach the definitive 6.0.0 stage are:
   - NTLM authentication
   - Digest authentication
   - Negotiate/Kerberos authentication
   
   Basic authentication IS working
