RELEASENOTES MARLIN VERSION 6.x
===============================

For releasenotes of the previous main version (5.x), see the separate file "Releasenotes_v5.txt".
This document contains all release notes and remarks beginning with version 6.0. The document
would otherwise grow to large and complex.

Version 6.x contains the new HTTPSYS user mode driver as a HTTPServerAPI replacement
It is tested through the "MarlinServerSync" test program only
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.1.2
------------------------
1)  New parameter "keep" in the logfile.config definition. In case of server log rotation, this is 
    the maximum number of logfiles to keep in one directory. This makes it possible to configure to 
    retain less logfiles than all the logfiles of the last two months.
2)  The "CreateServer" function for IIS applications has dropped two parameters (error-object and 
    logfile object). These objects can no longer be shared between applications. Logfiles will now 
    be separate for all application pools and the general MarlinModule in the inetpub/log directories.
    The separation was needed to gain more stability in the co-creation of web applications.
3)  It is now possible to place a debug version of the MarlinModule in the 'inetsrv' directory of 
    MS-Windows, provided you place it under a different name. e.g. "MarlinModuleDebug.dll"
    This makes it possible to integrate debug and release versions of applications within the same
    IIS environment.
4)  It is now mandatory to define a HTTP handler in an IIS site that relates to the MarlinModule you
    are using. Without such an handler, the website can never be started.
5)  Bug fix for CrackedURL when re-printing an URL. For the case when "m_secure" was set to true, 
    but no "https" prefix was provided. In this case the prefix will be appended an 's' to fix this.
6)  Bug fix in XMLMessage in finding an element with a namespace prefix. When searching WITH a 
    namespace prefix, the same names in other namespaces will be ignored.
7)  Bug fix in WSDL reading from a file, where the result of the read was not returned from the method.
8)  Bug fix in JSON parser for the line number.
9)  Bug fix for a report object in ServerApp.
10) If the settings of the application DLL are wrong, or the DLL for the MarlinModule is missing,
    the application pool will now be stopped in the "Unhealthy" method. This is a necessity, because
    the pool would otherwise be restarted many times a second.

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.1.1
------------------------
1)  Changed the working of the SiteFilters. Must now return a boolean value (true) to keep going in
    evaluating the SiteHandlers if you want to. So you can terminate the evaluation by:
    - Sending a response
    - Setting the status of the HTTPMessage
    and then return a 'false'. The general handler of HTTPSite will then:
    - Skip the HTTP handlers;
    - Send the return message (if still needed).
2)  Changed the processing of SiteFilters in HTTPSite. SiteFilters can return there own status in the
    HTTPMessage, instead of always producing a status "500 Server error"
3)  Added the possibility to add pre-emptive authentication to the HTTPClient. So it doesn't do a
    full round-trip to discover a HTTP status 401.
	To use this feature You must set HTTPClient.SetPreEmptiveAuthorization(DWORD) to one of the 
	following values for authentication:

	#define WINHTTP_AUTH_SCHEME_BASIC      0x00000001
	#define WINHTTP_AUTH_SCHEME_NTLM       0x00000002
	#define WINHTTP_AUTH_SCHEME_PASSPORT   0x00000004
	#define WINHTTP_AUTH_SCHEME_DIGEST     0x00000008
	#define WINHTTP_AUTH_SCHEME_NEGOTIATE  0x00000010


CHANGES IN VERSION 6.1.0
------------------------
1)  Added a new sub project "MarlinModule". This module is the one-and-only module to add to IIS
    the *real* DLL with the ServerApp derived project will be loaded by this MarlinModule bij reading
    the 'web.config' node <appSettings><add key="MarlinModule" value="path to the dll" />
2)  Added 32bits and 64bits installers for MarlinModule to extend your IIS environment
3)  Duplicate loading of DLL's is now prevented by the new MarlinModule.
4)  DLL's should always be in a subdirectory under the directory of your 'web.config' file!!
5)  Do not create any "web.config" with your HTTPManager any more. Always use "Marlin.config"
    to prevent any confusion in your environment.
6)  Optionally by prepending a '@' to your DLL path, you can set any absolute path to a dll.
    Please be advised that in this case duplicate DLL's or duplicate application pools are possible,
    but not neccessarily working.
7)  Try to adhere to the following default scheme:
    - 1 Application pool per website
    - 1 web.config per website
    - 1 DLL with a ServerApp derived application per website
    - 1 unique port per website. Do not use duplicate ports in your environment
8)  ZLIB directory for compressed content: varioius small code improvements (SonarQube based)
9)  Fixed double reset of the HTTPClient
10) Fixed leaking handle and leaking critical section resources from "Redirect" class
11) Added application settings to WebConfigIIS to be able to determine the DLL of an application
12) Fixed endless loop in checking of SOAPMessages in incoming WSDL cache
13) Added an check on an XMLElement node name if the name is a valid identifier.

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.0.1
------------------------
1) Upgraded to Visual Studio 2019
2) Small fixes for basic authentication of HTTP calls
3) Default charset of a MultiPart Buffer HTTP Call is "UTF-8"

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.0.0
------------------------
1) Nothing :-) Just a delivery

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.0.0 Beta 2
-------------------------------
1) Keep-alive connections fully operational

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.0.0 Beta 1
-------------------------------
1) NTLM/Digest/Kerberos authtentication working through standard SSPI interfaces
2) Rudementary implementation of keep-alive connections
3) HTTPServer now does send "Date" response header for authentication purposes

CHANGES IN VERSION 6.0.0 Pre-Alpha
----------------------------------
1) The HTTPSYS driver has been added to the project. It is a user mode implementation of the
   standard MS-Windows HTTP-Server-API as serviced by the "HTTP.SYS" kernel mode driver.
   It supports version 2.0 of the HTTPServer-API only.
   The driver was created for various reasons:
   - Educational purposes
   - Non-disclosed functions (websockets)
   - Because it can be done :-)
   Not implemented features of HTTP.SYS are:
   - Asynchronous I/O
   - HTTP 2.0 Server push
   - HTTP-Server-API release 1.0 functions.

   Applications can use the HTTPSYS driver just by altering the LINK input from "httpapi.lib" to "httpsys.lib"
   Nothing else is required to use the driver!

2) Yet to be implemented before we reach the definitive 6.0.0 stage are:
   - NTLM authentication
   - Digest authentication
   - Negotiate/Kerberos authentication
   
   Basic authentication IS working
