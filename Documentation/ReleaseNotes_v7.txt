RELEASENOTES MARLIN VERSION 7.x
===============================

For releasenotes of the previous main version (6.x), see the separate file "Releasenotes_v6.txt".
This document contains all release notes and remarks beginning with version 7.0. The document
would otherwise grow to large and complex.

Version 7.x contains the new MarlinModule that (again) allows to be used with staticly linked
application modules (DLL's), and so optimize the depoloyment and stack tracing capabilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 7.0.0 BETA
------------------------
1)  All Analasys logfiles removed from MarlinModule. All memory allocation from the loaded DLL's
    go now back to the DLL's. This is done so we can move back to static linked librarys and
    static linked MFC environments.
2)  The MarlinModule can be put in 'debugging' mode by placing a 'debug.txt' file in the
    %WINDIR%\System32\inetsrv directory. The file can be empty, it only need to be.
    Extra information will then be written to the Windows WMI log. Information that previously
    went to the "Marlin" logfile under ""C:\Inetpub\Logs\Logfiles\Marlin"
3)  All project moved from dynamicly linked DLL's to static libraries
4)  Continued work on WebSockets in IIS. 
    Reading and writing of messages longer than 1 frame now work correctly
    Websockets can be closed both from the client and from the server-side end of things.
5)  Please always use the "RegisterMessagesDllForService()" call in your server applications.
    otherwise fill in the ""g_svcname" global parameters. 
    Otherwise your application will continue to run as "Marlin for IIS" as configured in 
    the "Marlin_for_IIS" in the MS-Windows WMI Event log.
6)  Corrections in the CTOR methods of SOAPMessage. Copying of the headermap was added in
    all CTOR's.
