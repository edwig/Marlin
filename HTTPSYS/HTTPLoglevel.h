// HTTP Logging Levels (HLL) of the server and client processing

#define HLL_NOLOG      0       // No logging is ever done
#define HLL_ERRORS     1       // Only errors are logged
#define HLL_LOGGING    2       // 1 + Logging of actions
#define HLL_LOGBODY    3       // 2 + Logging of actions and soap bodies
#define HLL_TRACE      4       // 3 + Tracing of settings
#define HLL_TRACEDUMP  5       // 4 + Tracing and HEX dumping of objects

// Last & highest logging level
#define HLL_HIGHEST    HLL_TRACEDUMP

// In order to work the object's member that holds the HLL logging level must 
// always be named "m_loglevel" :-)
// So you can write "   if(MUSTLOG(HLL_LOGBODY)) .... etc"
// And thusly optimize the performance of your software

#define MUSTLOG(x)  (m_logLevel >= (x))
